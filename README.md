# Embedded-Systems-2-Spears-

This program displays basic use and initialization of vital embedded system concepts including PWM, ADC, GPIO, UART, CAN bus, SysTick and more. This code is not perfect but does exhibit important factors of modularity and cohesion. An effort was made to keep the code relatively clean and easy to understand. In preparing this program I have developed critical skills in understanding how embedded systems work and how to use them to achieve a goal. Additionally, I have gained the ability to program the key peripherals of the microcontroller.
